            <p id="essay">One of Naruto’s famous sayings was “Real strength is not what you have when fighting for only yourself. When you have something special that you want to protect, only then can you become truly strong!” (Lina, 2015). This is one of Naruto Uzumaki’s famous inspirational quotes throughout the Japanese series Naruto, Naruto Shippuden, and Boruto. During the series of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Uzumaki ends up fighting his way to the top, achieving his goal, and becoming known as the seventh Hokage. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are about a ninja named Naruto Uzumaki who goes on several missions with his friends and mentor and has grown throughout the series becoming a very powerful ninja through training and battles.</p>
